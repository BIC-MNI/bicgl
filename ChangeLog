	* various: Changed include from "foo.h" to "volume_io/foo.h",
	to "bicpl/foo.h", or to "GL/foo.h" to match current practice.

	* Makefile: Include one other file, namely ../Makefile.include
	which is provided by either Register or Display.  Removed many
	extraneous targets; will only build "opengl" library now.

	* Makefile.include: removed.

	* tagged as release-1_3: sources copied from ~david/Source/Graphics, 
	with several files rolled back to a revision that matches that found 
	in the `Display+register_src_v1.3' tarball.  In addition, the 
	following files from the tarball matched *no* revision.

	* GLUT_windows/glut_windows.c:
	* GLUT_windows/Include/glut_window_prototypes.h:
	* Include/graphics_prototypes.h:
	* IrisGL_graphics/Include/irisgl_graphics_prototypes.h:
	* OpenGL_graphics/Include/opengl_graphics_prototypes.h:
	copied from the `Display+register_src_v1.3' tarball, as
	no CVS revision matched them.
