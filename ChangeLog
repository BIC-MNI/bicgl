	* dirty hack to add Include/GL/*.h to enable compilation on BIC SGI

2005-04-02  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* OpenGL_graphics/colour_def.c: 
	* OpenGL_graphics/draw.c: Fix cast operations.

	* G_graphics/windows.c (reinitialize_window): Replace preincrement
	operation on enumerated type (illegal in C++) by if-statement.

2004-06-29  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Stub out copy_X_colours() in GLUT_windows/copy_x_colours.c,
	to avoid linking problems against FreeGlut.
	
2001-07-20  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* GLUT_windows/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Include $(X_CFLAGS).

2001-05-22  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* branch-1_3 merge: Many autoconfig files added.

	* various: Changed include from "foo.h" to "volume_io/foo.h",
	to "bicpl/foo.h", or to "GL/foo.h" to match current practice.

	* Makefile: Include one other file, namely ../Makefile.include
	which is provided by either Register or Display.  Removed many
	extraneous targets; will only build "opengl" library now.

	* Makefile.include: removed.

2001-05-22  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* GLUT_windows/Makefile:
	* G_graphics/Makefile:
	* OpenGL_graphics/Makefile:
	* Testing/test_graphics.mesa: Restored from ~david/Source/Graphics.

	* GLUT_windows/print_X_colours.c:
	* G_graphics/events.c:
	* Include/graphics_info.h:
	* Include/window_events.h:
	* IrisGL_graphics/events.c:
	* OpenGL_graphics/events.c:
	* Testing/test_globals.c: Removed.

	* tagged as david-source-2001-05-22.  This set of sources is
	identical to the current contents of
	~david/Source/Register/Graphics (with this ChangeLog added).

2000-10-07  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bottom.bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* GLUT_windows/Include/glut_window_prototypes.h:
	* Include/graphics_prototypes.h:
	* IrisGL_graphics/Include/irisgl_graphics_prototypes.h:
	* OpenGL_graphics/Include/opengl_graphics_prototypes.h:
	revert to revision 1.1, the newer version, as 1.2 was the version 
	copied from the source tarball.

2000-10-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* tagged as release-1_3: sources copied from ~david/Source/Graphics, 
	with several files rolled back to a revision that matches that found 
	in the `Display+register_src_v1.3' tarball.  In addition, the 
	following files from the tarball matched *no* revision.

	* GLUT_windows/glut_windows.c:
	* GLUT_windows/Include/glut_window_prototypes.h:
	* Include/graphics_prototypes.h:
	* IrisGL_graphics/Include/irisgl_graphics_prototypes.h:
	* OpenGL_graphics/Include/opengl_graphics_prototypes.h:
	copied from the `Display+register_src_v1.3' tarball, as
	no CVS revision matched them.
